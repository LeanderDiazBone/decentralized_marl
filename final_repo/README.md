This repository contains the implementations of the algorithms, environments and benchmarks used for the project "MARL with Local Observation & Communication" the Foundations of Reinforcement Learning FS24 lecture.

For the project we implemented the following algorithms. The implementation can be found in the algorithms folder.
* PPO
* IPPO
* MAPPO
* IPPO with Belief
* MAPPG
* QMIX

We used the Lumberjacks environment and the implemented the Cat & Mouse environment ourself. The implementation and the wrappers of the environments used for training can be found in the environments folder.

Finally, the implementation of all the discussed experiments can be found in the benchmarks folder.

Please refer to the paper for all details and references.
